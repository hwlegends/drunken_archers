# Drunken Archers

A physics ragdoll archery duel, built in React + TypeScript from the behavioral
specification in [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md).

Two unstable archers stand on separated platforms and lob arrows at each other.
You never aim — you hold one button to draw, and the shot leaves along whatever
direction the bow happens to point at the instant you let go. Reading the
drunken wobble is the whole game.

- **One Player** — first to five points against the CPU.
- **Two Players** — local duel, `W` versus `↑`, or the two halves of a
  touchscreen.
- **Deathmatch** — endless successive opponents; health is restored each
  encounter, difficulty ramps, and the best run is saved.

Headshots are instantly fatal, body and limb hits chip away at 100 health, and
falling off the arena is just as deadly.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server
npm run build      # production build to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
```

## Controls

| Context | Input |
| --- | --- |
| One Player / Deathmatch | Hold and release `↑`, or press and hold anywhere on the arena |
| Two Players | `W` for blue, `↑` for orange; on touch, the left and right halves (both at once) |
| Pause | `Esc` or `P`, or the pause button |

## Architecture

The rule in [REQUIREMENTS.md §2](REQUIREMENTS.md) is that React never sees a
per-frame body transform. The canvas layer owns the simulation and pushes only
low-frequency events — score, health, round results, phase changes — up to the
store.

```
src/
  config/       constants.ts   every tunable number, centralised
                arenas.ts      three themes + platform generation and validation
  game/         PhysicsWorld   Matter engine, fixed timestep, px/s <-> px/step units
                RagdollFactory eleven jointed bodies plus a bow, per fighter
                SwayController the drunkenness: body sway, stance, bow-arm sweep
                BowController  draw, charge, release, recoil, reload
                ProjectileSystem arrow flight, embedding, cleanup
                CombatSystem   the damage pipeline, defeat and scoring
                AIController   ballistic solving; fires the same bow a human does
                InputManager   keyboard, pointer, touch, focus safety
                ArenaManager   arena selection and spawns
                CameraController, ParticleSystem, AudioManager, Renderer
                GameEngine     orchestrates the above and owns the frame loop
  state/        GameStateMachine  the phase transition table
                gameStore.ts      low-frequency UI state (zustand) + persistence
  components/   GameCanvas, HUD, and one component per screen
```

A few details worth knowing:

- **Units.** Matter.js works in pixels-per-step; the spec states everything in
  px/s and px/s². All conversion is funnelled through `PhysicsWorld`, so no
  other module touches Matter's raw units.
- **The bow is welded to the forward hand.** Its angle follows the arm pose, and
  that angle *is* the shot direction. There is no aiming input.
- **The bow arm is driven positionally, not by a torque servo.** The elbow and
  hand are each pulled toward a point that orbits the shoulder, and the arm
  follows. The shoulder is a single pin, so a servo working on a wrapped angle
  error has an unstable equilibrium at 180 degrees and will wind the arm into a
  permanent spin; targeting both joints also removes the elbow-flip ambiguity a
  hand target alone would leave. The sweep carries the bow through roughly
  -4 to 44 degrees of elevation, across the useful 10-35 degree firing band —
  that crossing is what the player times.
- **The CPU plays by the same rules.** It solves a ballistic launch angle for
  its current charge, waits for the wobble to line up, and releases the string.
  It never teleports a projectile or sets an impact point.
- **Every asset is generated.** Characters, arenas, effects and interface art are
  drawn procedurally on canvas or as inline SVG; all audio is synthesised at
  runtime with the Web Audio API. There are no image or audio files in the
  build.

## Verification

```bash
npm run sim-check          # 60 headless physics/combat/AI assertions
npm run visual-check       # drives the built game in Chrome, writes shots/
npm run match-flow-check   # plays a full match to 5 and a deathmatch run (~6 min)
npm run typecheck
```

`sim-check` runs the real physics, ragdoll, bow, projectile, combat and AI code
under Node with no DOM, and asserts the behaviour the specification calls for —
gravity really is 1200 px/s², a headshot really is fatal, an arrow can only
damage once, pausing cannot jump the clock, and a teardown leaves no stale
bodies or constraints.

## About the reference material

This is an original implementation written from a clean-room behavioral
specification. [IMAGE_SOURCES.md](IMAGE_SOURCES.md) documents the reference
screenshots in `images/`, which are for visual research only — they are not part
of the build and must not be redistributed. All artwork, audio, characters,
naming and code here are original.
